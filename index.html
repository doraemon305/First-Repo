        So this is basically a normal text for you.

        <p> <strong> Here are some algorithmic random music examples in MP3 format. All examples have been created by letting SoundHelix remote-control 
            a MIDI software synthesizer in real-time with SoundHelix' built-in MIDI sequencer, while recording this with Audacity and converting
             the result to MP3 format using the Lame MP3 Encoder. Note that all songs with the same record date have been created with an identical
              SoundHelix XML file using different random seeds.</strong></p>


        <strong>But opps this one appears to be bold enough!!!!</strong>
